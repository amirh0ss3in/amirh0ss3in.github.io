<p>Hello, I am Amirhossein Rezaei, a physics undergraduate student at Shahid Beheshti University. My research interests include numerical simulations, complex systems, biophysics and artificial intelligence, and I have published research papers on topics such as hypermagnetic fields, COVID-19 epidemic prediction, and GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem.  You can find my research papers on my Google Scholar page here: [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xBOX2bIAAAAJ&hl=en) and my ResearchGate page here: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amirhossein-Rezaei-2). As a teaching assistant for several courses, I have gained experience in communicating complex concepts effectively.

	
I am also an active member of the Physics Student Association, where I coordinate events and seminars featuring guest speakers from academia and industry. You can find more information about my involvement with the association on [SBU Physics Website](https://sbuphysics.com/), [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/sbu_physics) and its [Instagram page](http://instagram.com/sbu.physics).

	
In addition, I have developed several projects, including Optimizing the Ising model in Python, a repository of Complex Systems ideas and codes, a comprehensive database of pollen grains, and a package for generating a 3D representation of the brain. You can find these projects on my GitHub page here: [GitHub](https://github.com/amirh0ss3in).

	
My current projects involve developing deep learning procedures for medical imaging, Classification of Intracranial Field Potentials in Human Visual Cortex via Convolutional Deep Neural Network and seismic damage assessment of offshore platforms using 1D-CNNs. I possess skills in programming languages such as Python, C, C++, MATLAB, and Mathematica, and am proficient in various tools and technologies such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit, and Git. My language proficiency includes Persian (native), English, Azerbaijani, and Turkish.</p>
